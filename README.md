# Binary classification with only positive examples

## What is positive-unlabeled classification?
Basically dealing with cases when we have only partially labeled data, one vs rest kind of use cases. For instance, urban vs non-urban where the "non-urban" areas are too diverse than the labeled data. This can also be framed more like outlier analysis problem
